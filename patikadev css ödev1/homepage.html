    One of Istanbul's splendid historical buildings is the Basilica Cistern located in the southwest of Hagia Sophia. This large underground cistern built by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527-565) was named as Yerebatan Palace ere among the people due to the marble columns rising from the water and countless seemingly like. It is also known as Basilica Cistern since there is a Basilica in the place where the cistern is located.

    According to one legend, Medusa is one of the three Gorgonas, the female monster of the underworld in Greek mythology. Medusa, the snake-headed of these three sisters, has the power to turn his ministers to stone. According to one view, Gorgona paintings and sculptures were used to preserve large structures and special places at that time, and this is why the head of the Carnica Medusa was placed.

    Wander through the 1500-year-old site and take a trip back in time. The first thing you will surely notice are the marble columns. Bathed in an atmospheric light, they rise out of the water and support the 6th century construction.
    While walking on the wooden platform, you can hear the cold water splashing down from the vaulted brick ceiling. If you take a look into the water, you may be surprised to see fish, as there are usually numerous carp frolicking in the water.
    Look for the two ancient columns that bear at their base the snake-haired Medusa, a famous figure in Greek mythology. You can find both mysterious heads on the northwest side of the cistern. 
    Another column to look out for is the one engraved with tears, a Hen's Eye, and slanted branches. It is believed that the tears are a homage to the hundreds of slaves who died during the construction of the cistern.
    Here you can relive the scenes from Dan Brown's "Inferno" starring Tom Hanks, James Bond's "From Russia with Love", "The International" with Clive Owen or "The Accidental Spy" with Jackie Chan, just to name a few.
